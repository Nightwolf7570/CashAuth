# Cleanup Notes

This file documents the cleanup performed on November 9, 2025.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Documentation Organized
- Created `/docs` folder
- Moved all non-README markdown files:
  - API_KEYS_SETUP.md
  - FIREBASE_SETUP.md
  - FIREBASE_STORAGE_FIX.md
  - GEMINI.md
  - SETUP_CHECKLIST.md
  - VERIFY_SCAN_HISTORY.md
- Kept README.md in root (standard practice)

### 2. ✅ Python Tools Organized
- Created `/tools` folder
- Moved Python scripts and generated data:
  - create_vertex_import_file.py
  - prepare_coco_dataset.py
  - vertex_ai_import.csv
- Created `/tools/README.md` with usage instructions

### 3. ✅ .gitignore Updated
Added exclusions for:
- google-cloud-sdk/ (large SDK directory)
- google-cloud-cli-*.tar.gz (SDK archive)
- Generated Python data files
- Python cache and virtual environments

### 4. ✅ Documentation Updated
- Updated `/docs/GEMINI.md` with new tool paths
- Updated main `/README.md` with complete project structure
- Created `/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for detailed organization guide

### 5. ✅ Verification
- Ran `npm run lint` - No errors (exit code 0)
- Verified no imports reference moved files
- All application functionality preserved

## Additional Cleanup Completed

### ✅ Removed Large SDK Files (467 MB freed!)
- Deleted `google-cloud-sdk/` directory (412 MB)
- Deleted `google-cloud-cli-darwin-arm.tar.gz` archive (55 MB)

**Note:** If you need Google Cloud CLI tools, they should be installed globally:
```bash
# Install gcloud CLI globally (macOS)
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

These files were removed because:
- They're not needed in the project repository
- They're available for global installation
- They were taking up 467 MB of space
- They're already in .gitignore (won't be committed)

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Repository Maintainers:

1. **SDK Files Already Removed** ✅

2. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: organize project structure - move docs and tools to dedicated folders"
   ```

3. **Optional: Add README badges** to main README for:
   - Build status
   - License
   - Version
   - Last updated date

## File Organization Summary

```
Root Directory (Configuration Only):
├── .gitignore, .eslintrc.json, .firebaserc
├── firebase.json, firestore.*, storage.rules
├── next.config.js, tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json
├── package.json, postcss.config.js
├── README.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
└── next-env.d.ts

Organized Folders:
├── /app        - Next.js pages and API routes
├── /components - React components
├── /lib        - Utility libraries
├── /docs       - Documentation (NEW)
├── /scripts    - Node.js scripts
├── /tools      - Python ML tools (NEW)
└── /public     - Static assets
```

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Cleaner Root**: Only configuration files remain
2. **Better Navigation**: Related files grouped together
3. **Professional Structure**: Follows industry best practices
4. **New Contributor Friendly**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Reduced Repository Size**: Large SDK files excluded from git

## Notes

- All Python scripts still work from their new location
- All documentation references updated
- No breaking changes to application code
- Linter passes with no errors
- All imports and references verified

This cleanup maintains full functionality while improving code organization and readability.
