# Demo Images

This directory should contain three demo images for testing:

1. `real-20-usd.jpg` - A real $20 USD bill (for high confidence validation demo)
2. `fake-20-usd.jpg` - A fake/counterfeit $20 USD bill (for issues detection demo)
3. `uncertain-10-usd.jpg` - A $10 USD bill with unclear features (for uncertain validation demo)

These images will be automatically uploaded to Firebase Storage on first load.

**Note:** Due to copyright and legal restrictions, you should use your own images or obtain proper licensing for currency images used in demos.
